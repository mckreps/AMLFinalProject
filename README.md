With billions of images posted every day in various social media platforms, there is enormous information that business can leverage from images. Facial image analysis has gained lot of traction in past few years due to its numerous applications across industries including music recommendation in restaurants/bars, better marketing for in-store customers based on demographics, security surveillance, etc.
<br>
We illustrate how gender and age can be approximately predicted from facial features using python and deep learning technqiues such as CNN and existing pre-trained deep neural network architectures(VGG, AlexNet).
